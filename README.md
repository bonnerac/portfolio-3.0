## Installation

* No installation needed. Just go to https://alexbonner.herokuapp.com/ to start!

## Design
* The site uses CSS grid to create a side navbar and a content page. The navbar is sticky, while the rest of the page can be scrolled. It is divided into three sections:
* Main  
Features a video background and staggered AOS animations.
* Portfolio  
Features three portfolio projects that flip on hover, revealing the title, a description, and links. Also features AOS animations.
* About Me  
Features a brief description of myself and the technologies I am proficient in. Uses AOS animations thoughout.
 
 Site also has two buffer sections, first between the Main and Portfolio section, and finally between the Portfolio and About Me sections. These serve to sepearte each of the three sections and use parallax.
