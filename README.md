* This 3x3 grid design supports all content of the site without having to redirect to other pages.
* It is designed so that the user only needs to click to navigate the site, no scrolling neccessary.
* Panel content includes:
  * Introduction (Panel 1)
  * Navigation (Panel 5)
  * Portfolio (Panel 4)
  * About Me (Panel 6)
  * Contact Information (Panel 8)
